# Locksport

This is just a demo of an idea I had. It's essentially a pin tumbler lock with a lockpick but everything's done with the physics engine.
Because it's 2D, the lock doesn't rotate, it's pulled out instead.

Most of the code is pretty bad and make no guarantees that it works. pick.gd _should_ be relatively decent if you want an idea of how to do click and drag with physics objects, though.
